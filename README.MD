# pixofcake

## description
Pixofcake is an imagegallery module for Websitebaker CMS. The goal of the module is to create a simple (like a piece of cake) photoalbum which can handele a lot of photo's. The module will display all the photo's in the specified folder and his subfolders.

You can create a folder and upload your photo's  with the media administration in the backend of Websitebaker. If you have a lot of photo's you could also use your favorite ftp program.

## how to use
When the module is installed and you've created a pixofcake page, the only thing you need to do is choose the subfolder of the media folder you want to use as photoalbum. You could also choose the media folder itself.

All the photo's in the folder with a height or width that is greater then 1500px will automaticly be resized. this will happen the first time the folder or subfolder is accesed on the frontend.
Thumbnails will also be created at this point.

With the check boxes in the backend you could choose if you want to display the thumbnail cropped to a format of 150px x 150px or not. When the thumbnails are not cropped, they all will have a height of 150px.
Whit the other checkbox you could choose whether you want to show the filename below the photo or not.

pixofcake currently only support .jpg and .jpeg images.
